=============================
Logging in for the first time
=============================

First-time setup
================

Once you have an account in your name, you'll receive an e-mail detailing how to activate your account. 

Since VPN's that don't share their usage in real time with the "iletişim başkanlığı" are no longer allowed in the campus, you'll need to use two Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) methods (one for the NAS, one for the Headnode).

First go to `Mistake not <https://mistake-not.de8.quickconnect.to/>`_ 

at your first login, you'll need to select a Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) method. You can use a security key (i.e. Yubico Yubikey), or use a time-based one-time password (TOTP) application in your (i.e. Yubico Authenticator, bitwarden, google authenticator, microsoft authenticator, etc.)

In the diskstation, in your files, you'll notice an important file called `carbon-totp-important.txt` In that text file you'll find your secret code for initiating a TOTP. Enter the secret from that file to your TOTP application, and you are good to go!

you can connect to our cluster using ssh {user_name}@carbon.physics.metu.edu.tr you'll be asked your password, and once every 24 hours, the code generated by the TOTP application.


Log in with SSH
===============

An *SSH* client (Secure SHell) is the required tool to connect to our group workstations. An *SSH* client provides secure encrypted communications between two hosts over an insecure network.

If you already have *ssh* installed on your UNIX-like system, have a user account and password on a Notur system, login may be as easy as typing

::

 ssh <machine name>         (for instance: ssh carbon.physics.metu.edu.tr)

into a terminal window.

If your user name on the machine differs from your user name on the local machine, use the -l option to specify the user name on the machine to which you connect. For example:

::

 ssh <machine name> -l [username]

And if you need X-forwarding (for instance, if you like to run Emacs in it's own window) you must log in like this:

::

 ssh -X -Y <machine name>

No matter how you login, you will need to confirm that the connection shall be trusted. The SHA256 key fingerprint of ``carbon.physics.metu.edu.tr`` is:

::

 SHA256:QiMKNx7rHlw/0Vv1bbi2yvWWV4+HQ2s5NknyajDxyHc

So you should get precisely this message the first time you login via ssh:

::

 The authenticity of host 'carbon.physics.metu.edu.tr' can't be established.
 RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:QiMKNx7rHlw/0Vv1bbi2yvWWV4+HQ2s5NknyajDxyHc
 Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

If you see this message with precisely this code, you can continue by typing ``yes`` and pressing *Enter*. If you connect to dilhan for the first time and ssh does *not* show you this key, please contact mbaris@metu.edu.tr immediately.



SSH clients for Windows and Mac
-------------------------------

At the `OpenSSH page <https://www.openssh.com>`_ you will find several *SSH* alternatives for both Windows and Mac.

Please note that Mac OS X comes with its own implementation of *OpenSSH*, so you don't need to install any third-party software to take advantage of the extra security *SSH* offers. Just open a terminal window and jump in.


Learning more about SSH
-----------------------

To learn more about using SSH, please also consult the `OpenSSH page <https://www.openssh.com>`_ page and take a look at the manual page on your system (*man ssh*).



Obtain a new password
=====================

When you have been granted an account on our group cluster, your username and password is sent to you separately.



**Important:**

If you are connecting from outside the networks of METU, you need to log into ODTU VPN
